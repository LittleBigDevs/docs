<Note>
    **FastFlags** are internal, configurable settings that allow Korone developers to remotely enable, disable, or adjust features and engine behavior without requiring a full software update.
    Users can modify these flags to unlock hidden engine settings, potentially improving performance or altering game features.
</Note>
With koroneStrap, you can apply FastFlags to Korone!
